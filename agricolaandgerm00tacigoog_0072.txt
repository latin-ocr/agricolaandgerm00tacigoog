’ 4· contubernio aestimaret] ‘Contubemio aestimare’
is to form a judgment of character hythe opportunities of close

companionship. The practice may be compared to the relation -

in which in ourservice an aide-decem stands to his general

Hiet. 1. ag, contubernalis appellando, where Otho wishes to make
his military1 ppdience feel that there is a tie of intimacy between
himself an em.

5· lleqpe Agricola ······ rettulit] The general meaning

is, that Agricola did not use the facilities afforded by his rank ³

either tc procura enjoyment or escape from duty. Hie rank ¹
(titulus) with one disposed to indulgence (expressed by licenter)
would have given opportunitiee for pleasure (voluptates). On the
other hand, hau he been idly disposed (expressed by segniter),
his inexperience (inscitie), l. e. the fect thet he was cf little use,

7· Anxius etintentusl ‘uarefulandvigilant'(oands); Δ
or ‘cmeful and energetic.‘ He was full of thought before the

time oi action, and when the time was come wholly occupied
with what he was doing. ‘Intentus' gives the idea of the full
tension ci energy.

8. ExcitatiorJ This is the coniectura of Buohner, which
we have followed Kritz in adopting instead cf ‘exercitatior’ It
means ‘more excited,‘ and would seem the natural expression oi
Tacitus in speaking of the native tribes; aestutiae· would epply
rather to the Roman province.
