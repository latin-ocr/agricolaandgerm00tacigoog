it 'au interval 01111000 years is thought too much
to be horne out by Pliny's propemodum (occurring
it must he rememhered, in a complimentary letter,
and irom its very employment implyiug 110 incon-
siderable differenee), we must not anyhow fix a later
date than au. ol or 52.

The town 01 Interamna (now Terni) in Umbria
hus heen named as the hirthplace 01 Tacitus. There
is no direct proof 01 the assertion‚ but itis known
that this town was in the third century the seut 01

the family 01 the Emperor Tacitus. This prinae, who .

occupied the throne 101· 0 few months after the death
01 Aurelian au. 275, was accustomed to claim descent
from the historian, end honoured his memory by di·
recting that ten copies 01 his works should he annually
uamcnbed and placed in the public librarios.

If our conjecture as to the date 01 his birth be
correct, Tacitus must have attained the period of
youth in the great year (69) which witnessed the fall
01 three Emperors. His descriptione of some of the
000000 01 that time, among which we may specifythe
eutry 01 the Flavianist troops into Rome (Hier. 111. 83),
look like the work 01 an eye-witness.

It hae been suggested that Tacitus made the
acquaintance 01 Agricola at sometime in the three
years (A 1). 74-77) during which that offioer held the
government 01 Aquitania. There is, it has been
thought, a particularity about his description 01
Agricola's administration which indicates the intimate
acquaintance 01 0110 who either held some official
position, or was otherwise closely connected with it

This position may possibly have included something .

01 the intimate relation in which Agricola himself
et the opening 01 his career had stood to §natenius
