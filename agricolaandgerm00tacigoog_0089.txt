58 CORNELII TAGII'I AGRIOOLA.

in meaning to alius, aud it certainly is unlikely that Tacitus would
even suggest a comparison between Cerialis and Agricola, as by
this interpretation he is made todo. For the expression ‘curam
famamque obruisset' comp. Oh 46, multos veterum oblivio obruit.
‘Obruisset’ (would have completely extinguished) is a stronger
word than obscurasset, by which it has been explained. By ,
‘molem' we are to understand the difficulty of the work imposed
on Frontinus, who had to complete what Cerialis had so ably
' begun. (lomp. its use Aac. 1. 45, haud minor moles supererat
ob ferociam quintae et vicesimae legionis; Hist. 111. 46, ne ex·
terna moles utrimque ingrueret. There remeius some difficulty
about the words ‘ quantum licebat? Their collocation seems to
require that they should be construed with ‘vir magnus,’
though Wex and Kritz take them with ‘sustinuit molem,' under·
standing them to mean'that Frontinus, so far as the difficulties
oi his position permitted, carried out the arduous task which
devolved on him. It is possible however that Tacitus, although
in this very chapter he has admitted that under Vespasian there
were ‘magni duces,' may be hinting at that Emperor's well-known

that an imperial reginae is sure to set limite on greatness. Julius
Frontinus had been praetor urbanum He was probably at this
time a praetoriam legatus in Britain, and seems to have com-
manded a legion in a different part of the count'rysrom that where
, -the operatione of Cerialis had been conducted. He was the
author of two worhs which have come down to us, oue ou mili-
tary stratagema, the other, on aqueducts. Pliny (up. lv. 8, 3),
speaks of himin high terme.

3· Ad securitatem ...... verterentur] The Mss. flue·
tuate between adurantur· and uterentur, which latter Orelli reads,

construing it with the ablativo ‘omissa expeditione! But ‘verte'
ad aliquid' is a well known phrase, aud suits the present passage
Oomp. Hlat. v. 11, Romani ad oppugnandum cerat, Aac. m.
38, omni aetate ad bellum cereo. So here comentur has a
middle sense. There is no zeugma, since vert ad securitatem, verti
ad occasionem, are both legitimate expressions. ‘Securitatem’
‘carelessness ε’ ‘occasionem' ‘an opportunity tor attack'
