a. Solis...edurat,] Tacitus endeavours to explain this
phenomeuou, Ayr. 12, where he speaks of the sun not rising or
setting, but only crossing the heavens.

3. mergentis] This appears to be the true reading,
and is adopted by Ritter and Kritz. Orelli, after Ernesti, re·

jects it aa an interpolation. Some word of the kind seems 10 bs
required. Lipsius conjectured se mergentis, as though Tacitus
were speaking of the remote west, 10 which he afterwards alludes
‘in this chapter. Here however hc is confiniug his description
10 the regions of the uomh, and the context would, on the
whole, indicate that heis referring 10 the north-east porticus of
Germany, and to the adjacent scas. ,

the splendour 01 the Aurora Borealis.

creaturas extends only thus far. Comp. Ayr. 33, where Agricola
in his speech 10 his army describes Britain as terrarum ac acturae
finis. The notione of aphysical philosopher 01 Tacitus’ age are
expressed by Avitus, 0 contemporary 01 Seneca, and quoted by
him 00 saying‚ Ita est rerum 001000· post omnia Oceanus, post
Oceanum nihil

8. ErgoJam dextro, 8ch ‘Ergo'(a word commonly de-
noting 0 strict logical conclusion) here implica that no more

nations are tc he found north 01 the Suiones, but that you murt
now go by the right (sc. the eastern) shore 01 the Baltic in order
to meet with fresh tribes.

9. Aestiorum gentes] Tribes to the east 01 the Vistula,
