Eis 'reason for so doing, that Agricola could not be pronounced
happy because his daughter and wife survived him aud were thus
destined to see the evil days which he escaped‚ seems far-fetched.
It must have been at least a comfort to him, as pointed out in
the next chapter, to have had his wife by his side during his last
illness.

11. Nam sicuti...0minabatur,] Riesrs emendation of
this passage (which he accomplishes by substituting quondam ior

quod) appears to be the simplest, and we have (with Kritz) adopted
it. We think too Kritz is right in reading hanc lucem for hac
luce, ae this is the regular construction with durare. There is, it
must be admitted, considerable difficulty about the expression
‘durare ominabatur,’ which may however be compared with a
passage in Hist. 1. 50, erant qui Vespasianum et arma Orientis
lidllltlt titiissalssiliiilltllr illiterati
tire. According to Dio, nxrx. ra (and Plira Poaep. 5, 94),
Trajan's elevatior was fcretold two years before Agricola's death,
and tc this Tacitus perhaps refers in ‘augurio’ Or we may
render ‘Trajanum’ by our expression ‘a Trajan! ‘Augurio
votisque ominabatur’ isequiralent io ‘augurabatur et vehe-
menter optabat?
