Rome. Tacitus, as also Juvenal, 1v. 145, terms it ‘arx,' to imply
that it was a kind oi centm aad stronghold of imperial tyranny.
Dio, uxvu. 1, describes it as the emperor's ἀκρόπολις, It was
here that he convoked the ‘pontifices' to pass sentence of death
on the Vestal, Cornelia. See Plin. Epp.11⁷.1r. Not till the
emperor’s later years were the counsels (sententia) of Messalinus
(whom Juvenal, Ν. 115, describes as Grande et conspicuum
nostro quoque tempore monstrum) heard beyond its walls.

8. Nostrae...manus,] Sc. the hands of miseratore, of
whom Tacitus at this time was one.

9· Nos Maurici Rusticique, tcc. tec] Wex, co avoid
the somewhat bold zeugma in the passage as it stands, reads

from the margin of one of the Vaticau MSS. Nos Mauricum
Rusticumque divisimus. This is a mere conjecture. Under·
stand aiter ‘visus' some such word as ‘perculit' or ‘afflixit’
The zeugma seems not too harsh for Tacitus.

10· Quum suspiria nostra subscriberemus] ‘When
eur sighs were made matter of accusation! Subscribcre (properly

‘to sign one’s name under that of the plaintiff or accuser’) is
continually used by the best writers as equivalent to ‘accusandi
and ‘iudices’ or ‘accusatores’ are also termed ‘subscriptam'
Quintilian, xn. 8. 8, has the expression adscribere audita (to
make what has been heard the subject oi a charge).

11· Denotandis tot hominibus palloribus] , comp.
Aren. 111. 53, In hac relatione subtrahi oculos meos mehus fuit,

ne denotantibus vobis ora ac metum singulorum ipse etiam viderem
eos ac velut deprehenderem. Denotare pallores is to mark out
with a view to destruction the men whose faces are beginning to
turn pale3 and the word ‘denotare’ answers to ‘designare' which
is used in a similar way in claustrae, notat et deripiant
oculis ed caedem unumquemque nostrum. It seems clear that
⁴ denotare' may be thus understood, and therefore Wea's conjec-
ture, denotandis...pallore cribro (which, though probably Latin,
strikes us as awkward) is needless. With this passage may be
aptly compared J uvenal's description oi Domitian's senate (IV. 74),
proceres, In quorum iacie miserae magnaeque sedebat Pallor
amicitiae. ’

1². Rubor...muniebat‚] The natural redness of Domi-
tian's countenance (of which Pliny, Paaey. 48, and Suetonius,
Domit. 18, both speak) rendered him proci against the ordinary
manifestation of the feeling oi shamc. Gomp. also litat. ur. aa, ,Χ

crebre aa consueto pro modestia accipiebatur.
