11000010, quite defensible. The idea is that of hand-tohard
fighting in 0 free open space, where the 11001 and most convenient
weapons would be sure 1ο tell. ‘In arcto’ (the reading adopted
hy Ritter and Kritz) is a purely arbitrary conjecture. Livy,
xxxvm. 41, thus describes va similar engagement: etsi iniquo
loco, praelio tamen justo, acie operta, collatis armis perquandum

8. Interim...haerebant.] This is a eornewhat confused
sentence, about the reading and punctuation of which editors
vary. The question iswhether the ‘equitum turmae' were 111000
of 1110 Romans or 1110 Β1110110. 11 the former, we must either
read ‘ut iugere' with Kritz, or take ‘fugere covinnarii’ with
Ritter, as parenthetically introduced, which seems exceediugly
'awkward and improbable. In thie case ‘equitum turmae’ would
no doubt be identical with the 3000 cavalry which, as appears
irom Oh. 35, were posted on 1110 wings of the Roman army. The
word ‘turmae' (a technical military term) would certainly seem
to point to 0 11001011 rather than 1ο any other force. It 10, how-
ever, applied Aeo. x1v. 34 to the Britons (Britannorum copiae

kinds of military force employed by them. It is thus possible
. that Orelli's view of the passage (110 have followed his punctua-
tion), taking ‘equitum turmae’ to mean the Caledonian cavalry,
may be 0011001. Itis not satisfactory, but other explanatione
