11. Ae amunieipia] Thisisinapposition with ‘senum
00100100.’ Ἰ eword ‘aegra’ denotes the feebleness arising from
10101001 diseord. Comp. its use Hist. 11. 86, movero 01 quatere
quidquid usquam 00111001 10101, adgrediuntur. (The Greek νοσεῖν
11 used in preoisely the same way. Soph. El. 1070, τὰ μὲν ἐκ
δόμων νοσεῖ.) Oomp. also claudian, Bell. Get. 437, vivusque oolor
redit urbibus osyris. Londinium and Verulamium had the oha-
10010101 ‘municipia' that is, theyhad their own ‘senatun' and
their own 01110011 101 the administration os justice. ‘Municipia’
appears to us on the whole 0 better reading thau that 01 ‘man-
oipia’ which Wex and Kritz adopt from the margin 01000 011110
Vatioan MSS, interpreting the words to mean ι010011100011
mutinous set 01 slaves) This ishardlyan appropriate descrip-
tion oi the Roman ‘veterani' ¹
