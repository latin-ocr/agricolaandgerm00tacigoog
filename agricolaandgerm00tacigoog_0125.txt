laudes (transitory praises) is the ‘laudatio funebris,’ which would
be soon iorgotten. This, we believe, is what Tacitus had in his
mind. He himself, as Pliny (Epp. 11. 1. ό) tells us, pronounced
a funeral &loge over Verginius Rufus. Lipsius (whom Ritter
follows) snbstituted from conjecture ‘immortalibus' for tempora·
libus ; but it would hardly have been in good taste ior Tacitus to
apply such an epithet to the present warh.
