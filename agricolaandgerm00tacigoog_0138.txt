inaccurate, and he now and then seems to attribute to
the whole German population the peculiarities ofa
single people. On the whole, however, there can be
little doubt but thot his work may be accepted as that
of a sagacious thinker and painstaking inquiror. He ,
has contrivcd to compress into a small compass much
really valuable matter, and has enabled us to perceive
in their earliest workings the germs of certain medi· .
eval and modern institutione. It would be too much
to suppose that he was guided to this result by a deli·
berate and consciens foresight‚ or that he ever so
dimly anticipated from what most impressed him with
admiration in the character of these tribes, the esta-
blishment of a new world on the ruine of the Romen
empire. Tacitus, we believe, was far too deeply im-
bned with Roman ideas to admit such a notion into
hie mind. He was no doubt struck with the eontrast
presented by the domestic virtues of the Germane to-
the corruption and profligacy of his countrymen, and
he continually avails himself of it to point the satire
of which he was so great a master. He felt, too, as is
evident from the ominous language at the close ol
ch. 33, that there was danger to the empire from the
side of Germany. But neither was his admiration of
the Germane by any means unqualified, as is clearly
shown by his exposurc of their vices, nor is there any-
thing to imply that he feared the worst for his coun-
try. On the contrary, the auspicious opening of
Nerva's reign, and the increasing strength and pros-
perity of the empire under Trajan, seem to have in·
spired him with new saith in the ,destinies of
Rome.

We gether from this work that the Germana were
not for the most part an utterly barberous people. 0f
