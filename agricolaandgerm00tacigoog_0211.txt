r. cham] This tribe is wrongly described by Creu,
B.G.1v.r ,nabranchoftlreSueri

a hoa] Ultra means further in a north-easterly
directiora It is a question whether ‘hos’ refers to the inhabit·
ants of the decumates agri (who are thelast mentioned) or to
the hdattiaci. Ultra would have a much ruore precise meaning
in the latter oese than in the former, as the settlements of the
Chatti bordered cn those of the Mattiaci. They were further
from the Rhine, and ιο the north of them. The passage from
Non numeiaverim to the end of chr has the appearance ola
parenthesis, so that it seems possible dwith Kritz) to understand
‘hos’ of the Mattiaci, the last German tribe mentioned.

3· Non ita effusis...] We hare adhered in this passage
to the punctuation ot Orelli and Ritter. Kritz does not seen

to make it much clearer by beginning a new sentence atthis
point, and taking effusis...locis as an ablativa which expresses
the cause of the Chatti continuing (durant) ιο dwell in their own
settlements, and not migrating as some of the other tribes. Itis
better ιο take it simply as an ablative of place, and to connect
it with the preceding. The following words, durant rarescunt
(which have been variously explained) appear ιο mean, ‘They
(the Chatti) extend, if (sc. wherever) the hill-renger extend,
and gradually dlminish in number as the country becomes less
hilly.' (Durant siquidem colles durant, paullatimqne rarescunt
siquidem colles remecurt). An antithesis seems intended be·
tween 'durant' and ‘inchoant’ Louandre, as we think,
rightly, rendere durant by s'y prolongent It is hardly neces·
sary ιο suppose with some interpretem that the word must
mean, ‘they endure to dwell,’ or ‘are constrsined ιο dwelL'
The territory of the Chatti would appear to have been rather
desirable than otherwise, when compared with the rest of Ger·
many!

4· (thattos suos ······ deponit] lberehsomething bold
and poetic about this passage. The Hercynian forestis person·

ified, and the Chatti are regarded as its ‘alumni’ ‘Deponit'
‘leaves’ ‘sees the last of.'

5. Stricti] “cluserat’‘ ‘Strictus’is opposed to laxus.
solutus, flaccidas.

6· Ut inter Germanos] Sc. ‘considering they arr
Germans,’ who as a mle were rash and impetuous.

7. Nosse ordines. Understand by ‘ordines’ ‘regular
military array.⁸ (lomp. iat. 1. 68, ordines sequi. The ‘sol
lertia’ of the Chatti ia illustrated entirely in reference to war.
