‘coelum ‘geographrcal position,’ as astronomroally and scienti·
fically determined. There is a reference ιο the division of the
earth into zones. It seems that Tacitus (in common with other
writers) believed both Spain and Germany to extend much fur·
ther to the north than they actually do. On this supposition his
meaning in this sentence would be that Britain lies op osite to
Spain ou the west, to Germany ou the east, arrd ιο (isid1 on the

south ; but that in the two former cases the distance is so con·

¹siderable thet the fact has ιο he inferred from certain considera·
tions (expressed by the words spatio ac coelo), whereas in the case
of Gaul it was a matter of ocular demonstration, Gallis etiam
inspicitur. It will be remembered that Tacitus included Scandi-
naria in what he called Germany.

9· oblongae scutulae, etc] It is not easy to see what
conception Tacitus had formed of the shape of Britain. He

seems to have shared the passion for discovering resemblanoes
common to the ancient geographers. It has been doubted whe-
ther ecztalo means a ‘dish,’ or a mathematical figure; and,
taking the later supposition‚ whether it significa a rhombus, a
rhomboid, or a trapezium. We incline to the latter opinion,
and may imagine the southern shore to be the longest side of
the trapezium. The opposite or northern boundsry would be
the shorteet. This ligure would bear some resemblance ιο the
bipennis, if we suppose the iren lead only of that weapon to be
intended. But from this nortbem boundary, which one might
have supposed to be the extreme limit of the country (extremo jam
littore) there extended a vest projection‚ narrowing in a wedge·
like shape (in cuneum). Excluding Caledonia (citra Caledoniam)
the country was like a scutum or bipennis. Α

10- In universumfamaesttransgressa.] The Mss.
favour the reading ‘in universum,’ which the sense seems to

demand. Because this resemblance is real as to part ottho
island, it has been supposed to be so about the whole. ‘Uni-
versie,’ which Orelli reads, and which he interprets in this way,
can hardly bear such a meaning. Kritz reads ‘transgressis'
which he takes to mean ‘among those who have croseed over
[from the continent into Britain].’ This strikes us as a very
questionable rendering.
