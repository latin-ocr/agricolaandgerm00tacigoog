5. Lacus] These ‘lakes’ (now known as the Zuyderzes)
are continually mentioned·in the account of the campaigns ot
Germanicus. See Anu L 60. 63. 70 and 11. 8. The “fossa Dru·
siana’' (Ano. 11. 8), which united the Rhine und YsseI, opened

a communication with the lakes in question.

· 6. Druso demonico] It seemsbeuerto ako this with
Orelli ol Drusus alone, the iathar of Germanicus, than with
Kritz of both the father and the son. Such an asyndeton would

be needlessly harah and obscure, as Ritter, who inserts oc, has -

noticed Drusus is spoken oi, Has. v. 19, as Dnrsus Germanicus.
His son was not so much an explorer as an avenger of the deleat
of Varus. This makes Orelli’s view the more probable. The
following words (Mox nemo tentavit), which seem to oontradlot
it, must be understood ot exploring expeditione rather than oi

ordinary campaigns.

3· Ι chaucorum gens] Pliny, EN. xvr. 1, divides the
Chauci into majores and minores, and makes the Visurgis (Weser)

the boundary between thena In Ano. XI. 19, Tacitus recognises
this distinction (missis qui majores Chaucos ud deditionem pelli-
cerent). The Ohauoi majores seem to have been settled between
the Weser and the Elbe, the minores between the Weser and the
Eme. Though in this passage Tacitus describes them favomany,
