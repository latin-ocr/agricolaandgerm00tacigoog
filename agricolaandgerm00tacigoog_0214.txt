their territory. We bave no historical record ol the event alluded
ιο in the words ‘pulsis ac penitus excisis.¹ It is not improbable

cnrshed by the Romans.

mentioned Ana. im. 55, where it is said tbat their original
. settlements were subsequently those ol the Tubantes and Usipii,

the Bructeri not being named. At this time they appear to have
„been settled on'the banks of the Weeer. The Angrivarii, as
may probably be iulerred from Ana. 11. 19 and 41, occupied
dietrIcts between the Weser and Elbe. Dr. Latham suggests
that the termination of the name is the ‘ware' ln Oautwarc and

inviderem. Quintilian, rx. 3. 1, remarks that in hit time the
ablativo was used with invidere when Cicero would have used the
accusative. We do not know to what particular event Tacitus
is here alluding. It must have occurred between a. n. 70 and
98 (the date of this work) since from several passages of the
Historiae (lv. οι. 61. 77, v. 18) it appears that at the commence-
ment of Vespasian’t reign the Bructeri were still in existence.

no doubt thinking of the pleasure which the Romans derived
from the gladiatorial contestu.
