Paulinus (119115). Howevcr this may be, itis oer-
tain that ator before this time an intimate acquaint-
ance had been formed between the two men. In
aa. 77 Agricola returned to Rome to fulfil the dutiae
of the Consulship. During his year of office he
betrothed his daughter (born an. 65) to his young
friend. Juoeai milti, says Tacitus, filiam despondit.
Juvat, like other Latin terms denoting age, is
elastic in its signification, but it is particularly appli-

thirtieth year. The marriage was celebrated in the
following year, the same in which Agricola assumed
his command in Britain

The illustrious alliance thus formed was probably
the means of introducing Tacitus toa career of public ¹
distinction His elevation, he says (Hiet. 1. 1) was '
“begun by Vespasian‚ augmented by Titus, and still
further advanced by Domitian.” What offices he may
have held under the first and second of these princes,
it is impossible to determine. Agricola himself was '
Quaestor and Tribune of the People before he reached
the Praetorehip. But the Quaestors were employed in
the Provinces If we suppose Tacitus to have re-
mained at Rome we may conjecture that he filled
the office 'of Aedile, and as Vespasian, his first patron
died June 23, nn. 79, that he was appointed to it
early in that year. Hie next office was probably that
of Tribune of the People, which, as Titus died Sept 13,
n. D. 81, he must have held either n. 1). 80 or in the
following year. We know 'from his own testimony
(Arta. xi. ll) that he was Praetor an. 88, in which
year Domitian celebrated the Ludi Saeculares. In 89
or 90 he left Rome with his wife, and did not return
. till after the death of Agricola, which took place
