purpose are clearly explained) that the ‘Germania’
was intended to be an appendix to the Histories, the
readers of which would perpetually feel themselves in
need of a fuller and more detailedacquaintance with ⁷
the country than could be conveniently given in the
course of the work This is at least a more probable
hypothesis than many which hare been suggested, and
which can be described only as groundless conjectures.
Ifwe are to have a theory on the subject, we incline
to think that ch. 38 which enumeratas the Roman
losses in Germany anda divells on the fierce indepen-
dence ottho people, more terrible even than Samnite,
Carthaginien, Gaul orParthian, hints at the motiva
which led to the compositiones this work. A coun-
try so formidable, from which alone, as Tacitus might
well think, serious danger was to be apprehended by
Rome, would at least be worth a description as full
and as accurate as his opportunities enablcd him to
give.

It cannot, we think, be inferred with any thing
like certainty from the contents and general character
of this work that Tacitus had ever visited Germany
and passed some time in the country. Kritz indeed
laboura to show in an elaborate discussion that here

and there matters are described with a precision and
particularity which clearly betoken an eye-witness,
and he lays considerable strecs on the occasional intro-

duction of native words which he argues would hardly
have been known to one who had not actually resided
in the country. His arguments, though ingenious,
do not seem conclusive. It is certainly by no means
improbable that Tacitus may have been in Germany,
but the various opportunities which he must have

had olgaiuiug a knowledge oi the country are amab]
