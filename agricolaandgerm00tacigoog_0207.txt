7· Hercyniam silvam] cesar, B· θ· vr. aa, ennean
to have regarded the Hercynian forestas almost coextensive

with the southern part oi Germany. Tacitus is here speaking
of its western extremity. The locality which he assigns to the
, Helvetii would thus nearly coincide with tha duchy oi Baden.
It should be observed that by Helvetii he means those vvho bad
quitted their own settlements, and had established themselves
by conquesta on tha German side ot the Rhine. of these move
ments no particulare are known.

. 8· Ulteriora Boii] Part of aas tribe socordius ao cca
sar, B. G. 1. 5, had crossed the Rhine and settled in Noricum,
perhaps in what is now a portion oi Bavaria and Bohemia.

ιο. Mutatio cultoribus] The Boii aad been expensa
by the Marcomanni (see ch. 42, and Aca. 11. 62, 63) under the

leadership oi Maroboduus.

11. Ab Osis, Germanorum natione] Here Tacita,
speaks doubtfully as to whether the Osi were a German tribe.

subsequently, ch. 43, he decides from their use of the Pannonian
language and the fact oi their patient submission to tribute that
they could not be Germana. ir we are determimed that Tacitus
shall not be inconsistent with himself, we must understand the
words ‘Germanorum natione’ to represent the current conception
about the Osi, which classed them among the German tribes.
Ritter has ventured to substituta ‘natio’ ior ‘mationa’ in order
’ to get over this difficulty.

rc. Quia, pari...ern‚nt,] ‘Because iu their like previous
condition oi poverty and independamus, either bank had the
same advantages and the same drawbacks.’ Understand by ‘ucri-

the Danube to the other.

13. Treveri] Caesar, B. 0. v111. ²5· describes the Tra·
veri as very like the Germana. It is singular that the Roman
general Cerialis in addressing them (Hiet. iv. 75, 74) makes no
allusion to this supposed German origin, but rather speaks oi
them as Gauls whom Roman intervention had delivered from
German oppressiou.

14. Nervii] One of the most powerful tribes of Belgio
Gaul Tbey were neighbours of the Treveri.
