⁴7· Formamque ac figurem] Formam isthe correction
ol Muretus for somam, the reading of the MSS, and is accepted

by nearly all editors. Oomp. (iic. Taso. 1. 16, 37, animorum
forraom alipuam atque firaram quaerebant. Tacitus uses the
phrase to encts the whole mind and character of Agricola.
Pliny'also uses it in connection with a very similar sentiment
(Pomp. 55), serenam principis figuramque non aurum melius
vel argentum quam favor hominum exprimat teneatque.

14. Obruit, This is Haupt’s emendation for obruet, the
reading of the MSS. It has the merit of bringing out more
forcibly the antithesis between ‘oblivio’ aud the words ‘narratus
et traditus) The allusion in ‘multos veterum¹ is to the times of the
republic, and the general sentiment may be compared with the
well-known passage in Horace, 0. lv, 9. 25,'Vixere fortes ante
Agamemnona Multi; sed omnes illacrimabiles Urgueutur igno·
tique longa Nocte, carent quia vate sacro. Tacitus thus hints
nore delicately at the effect of his work than he would do by¹
lescribing itas ‘laudes immortales!
