August 23, ar). 93. (Sco A9r.oh.45). Itis certain,
however, that he was in Rome during the last period of
Domitian's reign. The languagc in which at the close .
01 the Agricola he describes the horrore of that time is .
full of the bitterness, and even of the sslf—reproach 01
one who had been compelled to witness andto sanction

’ by his presence the cruelties of the tyrant.

Domitian was assassinated Sept. 18, A. ι). 95. Two
years afterwards Tacitus was advanced tc the dignity <
01 the Oonsulship. Verginius Rufus had died in his
year of office, and Tacitus was appointed to suoceed ⁴
him. He also delivered a funeral oration on his pre-
decessor. “ Hic supremus,'' says Pliny 01 Rufus
(spot. 11. l), “ felicitati ejus cumulus accessit, laudator
eloquentissimus.”

In s D. 100 he was appointed together with Pliny,
who was then Consul elect, to conduct the impeach-
ment preferred hythe Province of Africa against their
late Proconsul, Marcus Priscus Pliny, who relatos
the trial at length (Epist. 11. 11), describes his oratory
by the epithet σεμνῶς. Here the public life of Tacitus
terminated We hear indeed in one 01 Pliny's letters
(vu 9) 01 his interesting himself in the candidature of
one Julius Naso for some public office. We may ga-
ther from the letter that he was not then living at
Rome, and, perhaps, as he was not aware that Naso
had started under the auspices 01 Pliny, that he knew
hut little of what was going on in the capital

The date of his death is not known, but that he at
least lived down tc the end 01 Trajan’s reign, we may
infer from Aac. 11. 61, where he says that the Roman
Empire “ Nunc ad rubrum mare patescit,’' an expres-
sion which must refer to the successes obtained by

Trajan in his Baetem expedition (an. lli-117). Ι
