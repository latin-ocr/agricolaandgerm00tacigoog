4· Princi is dignationem] These words ure suscepti-
ble of two expidnutions. One is, thot they mean ‘the favour·
able segurd of ochief,' end his consequent willingness to admit
such youths into his comitatum the other is that dignatio is
here used cs equivaleut to ‘dignitas' It is not easy to choose
between these two meaniugs; us, however, Tacitus seems un·
questionnbly to use dipoatrb for dignitas, Awm 11. 33, 111, 75,
lv· 16,1v. 52,1111.20,Hi8f.1.1 , 1. 52, 111. 80, end Oh. 26 of
this work, we think it is likely cist it is thus used in this pss-
sage. The difference between the words appears to be that ‘dip-
nctio' auswers better then dignitas to our word ‘ rank) These
noble youths were considered ‘principes’ in rank, while they
were content with the position of simple ‘comites’

gestes magne cum propinquorum et clientium mnnu; 11. 45, ni
Inguiomerus oum manu clientium ad Maroboduum perfugisset ;
ΧΗ. ,3ο, Vannium-secuti mox cluntre.

7. Gradus] ‘Verious degrees.' These were determined
by the judgment (judicio) of the chief.

8· Haec dignitus...prcesidium.] We have adopted the
psmctuetion of Kritz in preference to thet of Orelli, es it seems,

on the whole, to give c somewhot better tum to the sentence.
The sense is not affected. ‘Dignitcs' it may be noted, is used

in c wider eud more general sense then ‘dignatio’ Here it ·

neerly mswers to our ‘prestige'

9. Id nomen, ea gloria] The following ‘si nurnero...

12. Ipse plerumque func] comp. Lily, xxv11.45,

13. ¹ Profligant] Profligare, not nctuelly ‘to finish,’ but
‘virtuelly to decide) Comp. Hiet. 1.1. 4, Profligaverat bellum J u-
dnicum Vespasianus. The wsu· with the Jews was not finished
because Jerusalem hed not yet fallen, but its result was no
longer doubtful. compulso Livy, ΧΠ. 40, Bellum commis·
