and rank (aetate et dignitate propemodum aequales).”
The questionis how far aequales must be considered
to be modified by propemodum. We think the word
should be taken to imply a considerable difference.
Pliny himself says, “When I was a very young man
(adclamatus) and you were at the height 01 your
Ι “ fame and reputation, Ι earnestly desired to imitate
you.” adolescentulus is a very'vague term, but Pliny
may be taken tc define this application of it to himself
· when he tells us (Epist v. 8) that he was in his nine-
tecnth year when he began to speak in the Forum.
He was, as he tells us himself (Epist. vr. 20), iu his
eighteenth year when the famous eruption 01 Vesuvius
took place (a 1). 79), and he must therefore have been
born ar). 61 or 62. We are inclined to put the
date of the birth of Tacitus at least ten years earlier.
In this conclusion we are supported by the passage
which we find in the third chapter 01 the Life os
Apoicolo. There he speaks 01 those who had survived
’ ’ the evil days of Domitian as coming under two
classes, the young men who had become old, the old
‘who had advanced tc the very verge and end of
existence? He must have included himself in the
former class. The Agricola was published before the
death of Nerva but after tho adoption 01 Trajan, ola
in' the latter part 01 the year 97. It may surprise us
that Tacitus could have spoken of himself as being
then an old man. But the term sopior was technically
applied at Rome (Aul. Gellius, x. 28, quoting Tubero)
to those who had passed their forty-fifth year. And

O. (lotta (in a speech tc the people preserved to us in
one 01 the fragments 01 Sallust) speaks 01 himself, he
being then fortycight, as an old man. Ι1 Tacitus
was fifty in an. 97, he must have been born ao. 475
