1.' In usuras extendere] sc. to continue taking a
‘succession of usurae, that is, to exact compound interest. Thin

seems the only meaning which brings out the force of ia usurus.

a Ideoque magis servatur] une subject of this
clauseis ‘non ienerad' which is to be suppliedfrom the pre·

ceding. We are here reminded ol what Tacitus remarks attha ,

end oi ch. 19, plus ibi honi morea valent quam alibi bonae leges.
On the evils connected with usury at Βοωο he dwelle particu-
larly, Aac. v1. 16, 17, where the somewhat remarkable phrase,

‘agitare lenue,’ is repeated.

3. In vices occupantur] We understand the meaning
to be that the land here spoken ol was oi the nature of ager

publicus, und was occupied in turns for the pnrposes of tillage,
the chiese and nobles having the largest portione. The distri·
bution ol the allotments would be changed from time to time.
This view accords with what we are told hy Caesar, B. G. vr.
. aa, that the magistrates assigned every year to furnilies and
clans settled on the same spot as much land as they thought fit,
and where they chose and compelled them in the course of a year
to go elsewhere. Nor does it necessarily clash with what is
'said ch 20, ‘that they live scattered and spart, ke! There may
have been (though Caesar, B. (ἕ. 1v. 1, denies it) fixed properties
along with such a system as seems suggested by this passage.

4· Secundum dignationem] ‘Accordingtorank.' The
chiei receives a larges portion than the nobles, and they again

than the other freeborn members oi the tribe. On dignatio, see λ

note 4, ch. 13.

5· Arva per annos mutant] Tacitus is speaking ol
change of occupancy, not of possession. ‘Arvum,’ ‘land under

tillage.’ Comp. Horace, 0. 111. 24. 11—16‚ where the habits
of the Getae are described, a Thracian tribe who are said to have
changed their lande annually. ’
