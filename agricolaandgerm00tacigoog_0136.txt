INTRODUOTION TO THE ‘GERMANIA.'

‘Genuam' was a comprehensive term in ancient
geography. It embraced certain territories on the k
western bank of the Rhine, as well as the vast and
imperfectly known tract of country stretching srorn
the cast of that river to the confines of Sarmatia and k
Dacia The first had been formed into two Roman

provinces in the time of Augustus. These were called
the two Germanica, or Germania Superior and Ger-
mania Inferior3 and they excen'ded [rom the northern
sea along the Rhine to a point a little to the south of
Basle. The latter, which is the subject of the present
work, was sometimes described as Germania Magna,
sometimes as Germania Transrhenanas or Barbara It
was, as we should expect, a loosely-defined area The

Rhine, Danube, and Vistula were its western, south· ’

ern, and eastern boundaries 3 the name, however, of
the last river does not occur in Tacitus, whose account
oi the eastern frontieris given in exceedingly vague
terma It is mentioned by Ptolemy as one of the
great rivers of Germany, and as separating it from
Sarmatia. Of the northern limita of the country no
ancient writer or geographer had a distinct notion.
All that was known was that there were vast penin-
sulas and islanda in the Ocean, which presented itself
to the imagination of antiquity aethe ultimateboun·
