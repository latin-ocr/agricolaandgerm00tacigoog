11, Ammo vultuque] Itisnot necessmytoenplain this
as a hcndradrs. ‘Ammus’ denotes the frame 11 mmd which

inclines a person to the usual manifestatione oi grief, ‘vultus'
its expression in the oountenance. Domitian’s assumed grief, ·
showed itseli not merely in bis looss but in his general demean·
our.

15. Securus J'am odii] ‘Being now careless of his hatred’
Domitian was now free from the anxiety with which his hatred
11 Agricola had filled him. Consequently, being at ease in his
mind, he could, in spite 11 his natural irascibility, so iar control
himself as 11 exhibit a show 11 sorrow. This he could not do as
long as he was afraid.

16. coheredem] This probably implies ,11111 Agricola
made the emperor heir to hely* his estate.

17. Piissimae] A form disapproved by writers 11 the ¹
Augustan age. Cicero (philipum. 19) twits M. Antonius with
having used it in referenceto Lepidus. '

⁷ 18· Velut honore judicioque] ‘(h0 was greatly pressea)
as 1111 were a compliment and a free choico! Domitian iu

this instance followed the example 11 such emperors as Caligula
and Nero, to the latter of whom Prasutagus, king 11 the Iceni, ·
and husband 11 Boadicea, paid the same complimeut with the

legaciesfrom those who had children, would afterwards claim
a deceased person’s estate ou the slightest evidence. See Suet
Dum. 9, 11. Pliny (Paneg. 43) speaks 11 the ‘security 11 our
wills'asoue 11 the happy features 11 Traian’s reign. For ‘judicic’
comp. Suet. Octcc. 66, where it is said 11 Augustus, that, though
he refused to accept any legacy irom strangers, amicorum tamen
supremajudt'cia morosissime pensitavit.

1. Decentior.] ‘Decens’ denotes graceand symmetryci
figure. The French translator Louandre thus renders the pss-

sage ; Sa tuille erait bien proportionnde saus 1111 haute.

2- Nihil metus in uultu] So Orelli and Wex. mo
MSS. vary. One has nihil metus et impetus, which can hardly

be the true reading, though Kritz adopts it. ‘Metus' here, aa
elsewhere, denotes that which causes sear. Comp. Quintil. 111111.
