jured person is represented by others. Gomp. Oh. cr for ue

10. RedduntJ The indicative expresses the actual imre
tiens performed by the chiefs. The subjunctive would oi oouiss
have substantially the same meaning, but would draw attention
to the purpose for which they were elected. It appears to have
been the office of these chiefs to decide private disputes aad
civil actions. Reddere jus or jura isa common expression, nd
,occurs Auo. vu. 11, xl11. 51, Hes. 111. 68. The idea of ‘rod-

ot the ‘centum viri.²

13- Consilium simulet auctoritas] In appositior
with ‘comites’ ‘Consilium' expresses simply the notionol
advisem ‘auctoritas’ implies the strength and su rt given
by these assessore, who were to the German chio what uo
‘judices' were to the Roman praetor.
