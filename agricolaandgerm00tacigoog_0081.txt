12· Superstitionum persuasiones-l se. ‘superstitious
belieis.' The meaning is that both the same rites (sacra) and the

same belieis prevailed in Britain as in Gaul. Comp. Caes. B. θ.
VI. 13. ‘Superstitio' denoted to a Roman ‘any foreign religione
belief) The reading oi the MSS. ‘persuasione' (retained by
Orelli) hardly admits oi explanation.

16. Quales Galli fuerunt] Kritz takes Galli to be tho

complement not the subject oi the sentence, and would translate

‘suchas they were when Garis? This seems unnecessary. The l
meaning is plain enough, ii we suppose Tacitus to say—the Gaulo ·
before they were conquered were great warriors; but military .
. spiritisincompatible with servitude. Servitnde has destroyed it y
in the Gaulo, has not yet done so with all the Britons3 many ol p
them still remain what the Gauls were. :

1. Et curru proeliantur] ,Tacitus' meaniugisthat their ;
troops generally consisted of infantry and cavalry, the former '

being the stronger force (in pedite robur); and that some tribes ζ
