portion.

CHAPTER XXIV.

1· Quinto expeditionum enno] AD. 82·

a. Nave prima] This is susceptible oi the following
meanings3 (Ι) the first Roman vessel which had visited those
parts3 (ι the first vessel which ventured tosea in the early
spring ς 83) the soremost vessel of the fleet; (4) the first venel .
which Agricola had as yet had occasion tc employ. The choica
seems to us to lie between (ι) and (3), and on tho whole we pre·
fer (1), both grammatically as the simplest, and as hest suiting
the context. It is iar ircm probable that Agricola quitted Bri·
taiu ior the winter and returned in the spring, as has been sap·

3. In spem] So. with the prospect oi some advantage. ,

6· valentissimam imperii partem] Salariam, Gaul,
Spain and Upper and Lower Germany. The special reference in

‘valentissimam' is to the military resources oi these ccuntrios.
We find, Hae. 111. 53, Gaul and Spain described as the most
poweriul (aalmtissimam) part oi the world, and the Britons, Oh.
ra, are spoken of as validissimae gentes.

7· Magnis invicem usibus misouerit-i ‘Hae united
with great mutual meantagesst The subjunctive seems meant
to express the writer's own notion of Agricoia’s views.

8. Cultusqm] Sc. ‘the general mode oi iiie?

‘ud' Haud· mpltupr..s⁰gnpfip We prefer this madi& to
ert m mehus, whrch, though adopted bysome recent edrtcn,

aiter Muretus, makes Tacitus responsible sor a strange and un·
accountable statement. We understand him tc mean that so iar
as he could speak on the matter, the climate and populationci
