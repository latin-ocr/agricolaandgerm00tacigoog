to be referred to the Romans. Lipsius, however, understood

them oi the Britons. ’

CHAPTER XXXVII.

ι. Vacui] This means much the same as ‘securi‘ Here,
as frequently, the less usual word is preferred hy Tacitus.

a. Ad subita, belli] ‘For the sudden emergencies of
war) The same phrase occurs Hiar. v. 13.

3. Ferocius] The word implies the notion of ‘dash'and
‘impetuosity’

4. ⁴ In ipsos versum] ‘Receded upon themselves) na
Britons who tried to take the Romans in rear, were themselves

thus attached.

5· Aversam hostium aciem] Sc. ‘theenemy‘rreaa’ ·

6. Tum vero, 800] Tacitus, as Lipsius was the firstto
point out, seems to have had in his mind the following passage
from Sallust, Ju9.101:tum spectaculum horribile campis par
tentibus; aequi, fugere, occidi capi, equi, viri afflicti, ac multi
vulneribus acceptis neque fugere posse neque quietem pati, niti
modo aestatim concidere; postremo omnia qua visus erat con·

oi recent editors. Something stands in the MSS. before ‘cellach'
which Ritter conjectures to be inde, Halm (whom Kritz follows)
more ingeniously, identidem, which conveys the idea oi repeated
sudden attacks made hy the flying army on the pursuers. 'l’he
general sense of the passage is clear enough, but we ean hardly
hope to restore the original with precision.
