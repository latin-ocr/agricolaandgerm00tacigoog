8. Mutuum dissimulationem-i ‘A mutual consumens
of guilt’ rO and B). (implicitura, uices impunitatis, and
Plin. Epp. rx.13, &uatus severus in ceteros senatoribus solis
dissimulatione quaa mutua parceret.

9. Subsidium] This possibly refers ‘to the advantage
which a candidate derived from having children. Oomp. Aac. 11.
51, plerique nitebantur ut cumeae ¹liberorum ia madore proe-
potaret. This would be to carry out the provisione of th'e lex

Papia Poppaea. We proferto gireitamore general signification. .

ιο. Sublatam] ‘Bora’ a phrase derived from the custom
by which a Romen father took up (sustulit) the child whom he
acknowledged, and wished to rear.

11. Brevi amisit] This does not necessarily mean what
Ritter understands by it, that the son died before the daughter
was born. In that case we should rather have expected ‘ami-
serat’ The daughter was a ‘subsidium' as iucremiug his family,
and when he lust his son became a ‘solatium’

1'2. uibus inertia ...... fuit] Oomp. Tacitus’ account of

Galba, ist. 1. 49, metus temporum obtentui init, ut quod ,

{0 aud’Bh hIt is possible that ‘ducere' may be equivalent to
..dludi autistiti} ltili attitulatis l}
expressed by the phrase ‘ducere pompam.¹ It seems better, how-
ever, to connect ‘duxit' closely with ‘medio,’ as if Tacitus meant
tosay ‘he conducted them along the middle course? Ritter con-
siders it to be equivalent to ‘arbitratus est,' but to make cut
this view he has to adopt the violent course of substituting for
‘medio rationie' Lipsius conjecture oi moderationis.

16. Famae propior] Sc. rather gairing distinction from
them than otherwise. Though the exhibition was not prodigally
ostentatione, there was enough splendour about it tc attract admi·
ration. Tacitus, it will be ramembered, was himself praetor, and
in that capacity presided over the' Ludi Saeculares exhibited by
Domippan, an. 88. See Aac. 11. 11, where he mentions this ci
