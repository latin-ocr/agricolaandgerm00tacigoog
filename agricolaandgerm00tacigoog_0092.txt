Orelli retains aud endeavours to explain) seems tc he unquestion·
ably the right reading and is now generally adopted. By ‘cen-

under two heads, (r) contributione oi corn, (ι) the payment of
a money-tribute. The first would necessarily be vexatione in
districts where coru was scarae. For this difficulty Agricola
found a remedy by requiring in such cases as an equivalent pay·
ment the average price which corn ietohed in parts where it was
more plentiful. This was done by means of an assessment,
‘aestimatio frumenti,' as it was termed‚ a phrase we meet with
(ξε. Vcrr. 111. 82, where the whole matter is explained.
